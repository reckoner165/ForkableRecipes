## Ingredients

- Small head of green (or red) cabbage:
  1

- Olive oil:
  4tbsp

- Grated lemon zest:
  2 tbsp

- Dijon mustard:
  1.5tbsp

- Grated parmesan cheese:
  1/3 cup

- Plain greek yogurt:
  1/3 cup

- Mayonnaise (kewpie works very well):
  1/4 cup

- Water:
  2tbsp

- Salt

- Minced garlic:
  1tbsp (or) 2 cloves

- Fresh oregano leaves (optional)

## Directions

- Line a large rimmed baking sheet with foil; place in oven. Preheat oven to 400Â°F.
- Peel wilted layers, and cut the cabbage into 8 wedges. Leaving the root can keep the cabbage intact, but get rid of it if it's too hardy
- Whisk oil, half of the garlic, salt, lemon zest and 1/2 teaspoon mustard together
- Brush both sides of the cabbage wedges with the mixture
- Arrange the cabbage wedges in the heated baking sheet, 400F for 40-45min until tender. Flip halfway through
- Mix Parmesan, yogurt, mayonnaise, water, garlic, lemon juice and mustard to make the dressing
- Drizzle the wedges with dressing in a serving plate. Add parmesan and herbs

### Variations

- Sprinkling a little bit of cayenne pepper on top of the salad can add a spicy overtone to the whole thing
- Crutons could work very well with the caesar-salad vibe of this dish
- You could add nutritional yeast to the mixture brushed onto cabbage for extra umami flavor
